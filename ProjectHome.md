Lightweight persistence library for Android. It simplifies work with SQLite database by providing high level APIs which allows to perform CRUD operations directly with Java classes. The big benefits of this library is its ability to persist Java objects without writing a boilerplate code for mapping between Java and SQL.

Currently supported features:
  * Automatically generates database tables based on Java classes structure;
  * Transparent CRUD (Create/Update/Delete) operations without writing SQL statements;
  * Automatic mapping of Java objects to SQlite tables
  * Enhanced logger (wrapper around standard Log class)
    * Provides 'printf'-like methods for writing log messages
    * Supports indentations in log messages
    * Very simple but useful class and it can be used standalone from the rest of the library

_The project is still in active development phase, therefore it lacks compiled binaries and documentation, but this will come soon._
